## TipCalCulator


I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a working TipCalculator .
Tip calculator app finds out the amount for the tip based on the bill amount and tip percent (either custom or preset).

###Features for the app:

How much was your bill ? 
(From 0-999999999)
How was your service ?
(Preset tip from 5 Percent-30 percent)

How many people are sharing the bill?
(ranges from 1 person all the way up to a 100)
